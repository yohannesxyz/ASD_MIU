Without Composite Pattern
Advantages:

Type Safety: Each class is clearly defined, ensuring strong type safety.
Specialized Behavior: Each class can have specialized behavior, making it easier to handle specific cases.
Disadvantages:

Complexity: More classes and relationships make the system harder to maintain and extend.
Rigid Structure: Adding new node types requires significant changes.
Code Duplication: Common functionality might need to be duplicated across classes.
With Composite Pattern
Advantages:

Flexibility: Simplifies the structure by using a common interface, making it easier to add new node types.
Reusability: Common operations are implemented once, reducing code duplication.
Simplified Client Code: Client code can treat all nodes uniformly, reducing type checks and casting.
Disadvantages:

Less Type Safety: A common interface for all node types can lead to less type safety and potential runtime errors.
Generalization of Behavior: Specific behaviors need to be handled within the same class, which can blur responsibilities.
Performance Overhead: Additional abstraction layers may introduce performance overhead.
