Advantages:

Separation of Concerns: It separates the algorithm from the object structure, promoting cleaner code and better separation of concerns.
Extensibility: You can add new operations to existing object structures without modifying those structures.
Single Responsibility: Each visitor class has a single responsibility, making the system easier to understand and maintain.


Disadvantages:

Complexity: It can increase the system's complexity, especially if there are many different visitor classes.
Dependency: Visitors need to know the structure of the objects they visit, creating a dependency between the visitor and the object structure.
Object Structure Changes: If the object structure changes frequently, it can be costly to maintain the visitor implementations.
